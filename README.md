# Traffic Analysis

The project will **construct** the Traffic Situations.

And several Analysis will be performed to **simulate** the traffic pressure under different conditions.

Last but not least, the **optimized** implementation of traffic situation will thus be proposed.

The Project contains `3` components as planned

- Traffic Situations Construction

   Construct traffic situations in graph manner.

- Traffic Pressure Simulation

   Simulate the traffic situation with a large number of cars.

- Optimized Implementation

    Evaluate and optimize the traffic situation based on the simulations.
